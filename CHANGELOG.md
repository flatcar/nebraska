## [v2.13.0] - 21/10/2025

### Security
- **OIDC Implementation Refactor - Authorization Code Flow with PKCE** ([nebraska#642](https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/642))
  - Tokens no longer exposed in server logs or query parameters
  - Frontend handles OIDC flow directly with identity provider using PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
  - In-memory token storage prevents XSS vulnerabilities
  - Stateless backend architecture eliminates session storage related vulnerabilities

### Breaking Changes
- **OIDC Authentication**: Complete refactor requiring migration (see [OIDC Migration Guide](docs/oidc-migration-guide.md))
  - **Removed configuration options**:
    - `--oidc-client-secret` / `NEBRASKA_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` - OIDC now requires public client type
    - `--oidc-valid-redirect-urls` - No longer needed with direct frontend flow
    - `--oidc-session-secret` / `NEBRASKA_OIDC_SESSION_SECRET` - Backend is now stateless
    - `--oidc-session-crypt-key` / `NEBRASKA_OIDC_SESSION_CRYPT_KEY` - No server-side sessions
  - **Removed API endpoints**:
    - `GET /login` - Frontend initiates OIDC flow directly with provider
    - `POST /login/token` - Password grant type no longer supported
    - `GET /login/cb` now returns 501 for OIDC mode (GitHub mode only)
  - **Changed default scopes**: From `openid,offline_access` to `openid,profile,email`
  - **Migration requirements**:
    - OIDC provider must be reconfigured from confidential to public client type
    - CORS must be enabled for Nebraska domain on OIDC provider if it is not hosted under the same domain
    - Recommended: Enable session cookies on OIDC provider for seamless SSO re-authentication
      - Configure SSO session duration to 8-12 hours (idle timeout) and 1-7 days (maximum lifetime) based on your security requirements
      - **Keycloak**: Configure "SSO Session Max" and "SSO Session Idle Timeout" under Realm Settings → Sessions
      - **Auth0**: Configure "Maximum Session Lifetime" and "Idle Session Lifetime" under Tenant Settings → Advanced → Session Expiration
      - NOTE: Many times, these SSO session attributes are already set by default
    - When access tokens get lost after page refresh, the OIDC provider automatically re-authenticates users if SSO session is still active (no password re-entry required)
    - Recommended: Configure OIDC provider access token expiration to 1-8 hours (should be less than the SSO maximum session lifetime)

### Changed

- helm/postgresql: temporarily overwrite PostgreSQL subchart images to the Bitnami Legacy registry (`bitnamilegacy/*`) to restore Helm chart deployments after Bitnami Docker Hub deprecations. This is a short-term workaround only; Bitnami Legacy images are archived and will not receive security updates.
- backend: OIDC authentication refactored to use standard SPA authentication pattern with stateless JWT validation ([nebraska#642](https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/642))
- frontend: Implements OIDC Authorization Code Flow with PKCE directly, removing backend proxy ([nebraska#642](https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/642))
- api: Note that `oidcCookieAuth` security scheme in OpenAPI spec was never implemented and should be removed in future cleanup

## [v2.12.0] - 28/08/2025

### Security
- **form-data@4.0.3 → v4.0.4**
  - Fixes CVE-2025-7783 (GHSA-fjxv-7rqg-78g4): Critical vulnerability (CVSS 9.4) where form-data uses Math.random() for selecting multipart/form-data boundary values. This predictable randomness could allow attackers to inject additional parameters into requests (HTTP Parameter Pollution), potentially making arbitrary requests to internal systems. Affected versions: <2.5.4, 3.0.0-3.0.3, 4.0.0-4.0.3. Fixed in: 2.5.4, 3.0.4, 4.0.4. Updated via npm audit fix. ([#1146](https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/1146))
- **github.com/go-viper/mapstructure/v2 → v2.3.0**  
  - Fixes GHSA-fv92-fjc5-jj9h: Prevents sensitive information leakage in error messages during type conversion failures (https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/1099)

### Breaking Changes

- Postgresql 17.x is now the tested and default version. For existing Kubernetes deployment, you might need to run a manual intervention (see: [charts/nebraska/README.md](https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/blob/main/charts/nebraska/README.md#upgrade-postgresql))([nebraska#1088](https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/1088))

### Added

- helm: add ability to specify extra annotations and labels for pods, PVCs, ingress, deployments, and other resources ([nebraska#1097](https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/1097/files))

### Changed

- backend: updated kinvolk references to flatcar ([nebraska#1091](https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/1091/files))
- backend: migrate from go-bindata to embed ([nebraska#1132](https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/1132))
- backend: update go to v1.24 ([nebraska#1130](https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/1130/files))
- updater: update go to v1.24 and remove final kinvolk references ([nebraska#1151](https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/1151/files))

### Bugfixes

## [v2.11.0] - 17/06/2025

### Security

- **Dependency Audit & Vulnerability Mitigation:**
  - In the pursuite of a clean `npm audit` outcome free of vulnerabilities removed legacy CRA/Webpack dependencies that relied on unmaintained libraries, posing ongoing security risks. [See the Internal / Maintenance Notes](#internal--maintenance-notes) for further details.
- **golang.org/x/net → v0.38.0**
  - Fixes CVE-2025-22870 and CVE-2025-22872 in the HTML tokenizer/parser (https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/1016)
- **golang.org/x/crypto → v0.35.0**

### Internal / Maintenance Notes

- The legacy CRA/Webpack setup, although reliable in the early stages, has become increasingly difficult to maintain due to slow update cycles and performance inefficiencies.
- Transitioning to Vite and Vitest was driven by the need for a modern build and testing environment that offers faster development cycles, improved maintainability, and a cleaner security profile.
- Switched from Jest to Vitest to leverage a Vite-native testing environment, enhancing overall developer experience with faster test cycles.
- Upgraded react router to v7 (https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/1048)
- improved HMR
- Updated and standardized ESLint and Prettier configurations.
- Removed the deprecated `headlamp` dependency.
- Introduced `eslint.config.js` to centralize and simplify linting rules.
- Moved `index.html` from the `public/` folder to the root (`frontend/`) to better align with Vite’s optimal project structure and optimized the file for Vite usage.
- Reformatted and cleaned up End-to-End (E2E) test files to enhance clarity and consistency.
- Add badges to README for CI/status/integration (https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/993)

### Refactors & Improvements

- **MUI Upgrade:**
  - Minor visual improvements
    by upgrading @mui/material, @mui/system, @mui/icons-material, @mui/utils, @mui/styles, @mui/styled-engine-sc to ^7.0.0 (https://github.com/flatcar/nebraska/pull/1040/files)
- **Icon Management:**
  - Refactored the icon builder to utilize the new Iconify API for improved performance and maintainability.
- **General Codebase Improvements:**
  - Optimized import arrangements and removed unused parameters across multiple functions.
  - Enhanced the `package.json` scripts for development, testing, and build processes.
  - Updated various minor and major dependencies to maintain compatibility and stability.
